## Hi there, here Camilo ðŸ‘‹


**Camilo-ovalle/Camilo-ovalle** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a software developer based in Bogota, Colombia, and I always have been interested in the technology and development industry.

I built my first website when I was 17 years old when I was in middle school and since that day I got hooked on this fascinating world and made it part of my life.

Based on that, I have always been part of the IT departments of all companies where I worked, acting as a consultor about technology, solving most of the tech issues that my coworkers had, and acting as the head leader when the situation demanded it, and that way I wis able to be in touch with the tech department of my last job, based in the USA, solving network and connection issues and modifying and updating the main production program.
